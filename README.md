# Scripts
This will have a list of all the Scripts that I have made and what they do.

1.Desktop Cleaner Script -  This takes all the files on your desktop and puts them into separate folders depending on the file extensions. Ex: all jpg files will get placed into a jpg folder and etc...
All you have to do is put the directory path you want to get cleaned and organized. You can also do the downloads directory or any directory you would like to do.
